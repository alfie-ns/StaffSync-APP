# Set-Exercises COMP2000 Software Engineering

- [X] Put printed PDF in this repository

# Set Exercise 1: (5 marks)

- [X] Analyse the scenario to identify the context of use and the user(s) of the system.

# Set Exercise 2: (15 marks)

- [X] Produce a design of the UIs for a client-side mobile application - a low-fidelity prototype (i.e. paper-based prototype) and provide a storyboard. The design should follow the HCI principles learnt during the semester.

# Set Exercise 3: (25 marks)

- [X] Carry out a user testing study (Formative usability evaluation) for the initial design using the paper-based prototype:
- [X] Invite a minimum of two potential users.
- [ ] Set the user study based on the knowledge gained in the course, using one of the user testing methods learnt.

# Set Exercise 4: (15 marks)

- [X] Re-design the UIs based on the outcome of the user testing in the previous exercise (users’ feedback).
- [X] Highlight the changes with a brief explanation.
- [X] Consider different screen sizes for various mobile devices.
- [X] Produce a storyboard for the final design with an appropriate narrative to describe each interface from the user’s perspective.

# Set Exercise 5: (30 marks)

- [X] Implement the final UIs design of the employee side using Java and Android Studio (i.e. a high-fidelity prototype).
- [X] The interfaces should be interactive, and all links should be working (no need to link to a database at this stage).
- [X] Active menus and icons should be interactive.
- [X] Notifications should be shown to notify users based on their preferences.

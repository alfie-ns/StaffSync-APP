# Checklist

This checklist is to help you work out if you have included everything in your submission; please use this with the assessment brief but not as substance.

---

### [ ] Scenario-Based

- [ ] Your coursework should be based on the scenario provided in the appendix in the assessment brief.

---

### [ ] Design and Storyboard

- [X] You may either use the final app design created in CW1 or create a new design that includes all app interfaces if you’ve made updates.
- [ ] Clearly explain your design choices in the report, linking them to the design principles covered in the lectures.
- [ ] Your storyboard should accurately illustrate the functionality of the final solution being submitted.

---

### [ ] Implementation

- [X] Develop your app using Android Studio (Java)
- [ ] ensuring it reflects your design.

---

### [ ] API Integration

- [X] Connect your app to the provided API to retrieve and display data. Ensure the following functionalities:
  - **[X] Admin Users**: Perform all actions for managing all employees.
  - **[X] Employee Users**: View their details and edit their names.
  - **[ ] Leave Management**: Leave should be approved by admin before it is updated on the main database via API.

---

### [ ] Local Database

- [X] Use SQLite for storing login information and other relevant data locally.
- [ ] Clearly separate functionalities for different user types in the application.

---

### [ ] Key Factors for Design

- [ ] Implement design patterns to structure your app.
- [ ] Demonstrate adherence to SOLID principles to ensure clean and maintainable code.
- [ ] Include a notifications feature in your app.
- [ ] Use worker threads to handle resource-intensive tasks.

---

### [ ] Functional Requirements

- [ ] Ensure all functional requirements outlined in the assessment brief are implemented.
- [ ] Provide a clear explanation of your implementation logic, as this will be critical to your evaluation.

---

### [ ] Evaluation

- [ ] Conduct a post-design evaluation to assess the usability and functionality of your app.
- [ ] Based on your evaluation, provide recommendations for future improvements to the app.

---

## [ ] Report Requirements

- [ ] Submit all your work in a single PDF document, which must include the following:
  - [ ] Screenshots/Images of your app design and provide clear explanations of the interface components.
    - [ ] Ensure screenshots are legible and specify the device used (e.g., mobile phone).
    - [ ] Include links to the XML files (on the module GitHub repository) in figure captions for each UI screen.
  - [ ] User test details, including:
    - [ ] Participant details, test plans, study settings (with evidence such as photos or videos), procedures followed, consent forms, techniques used, and outcomes.
  - [ ] Provide a link to your GitHub repository containing your code and a link to the demo video in your report so that they are clearly visible and easily accessible.
  - [ ] Include relevant code snippets for each functional component, with explanations of their functionality and integration within the app.

---

## [ ] Submitted Video

- [ ] The video should be 3–5 minutes long, demonstrating all the functional components of your application.

---

### [ ] Final Checks

- [ ] Ensure all content in the PDF is clearly readable.
- [ ] Verify that the audio in your demo video is clear and easy to understand.

The report and demo video will be the primary materials used for evaluating your coursework. (For more details, refer to the assessment brief.)
